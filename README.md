# metrics bubble

This project has a small "metrics" widget that can be reused across different views. This widget
displays a weight and a label. It can be used, for example, in the summary view for a strength
assessment.

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

[![style: lint](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-lint-4BC0F5.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/lint)

• Programming language: [Dart](https://dart.dev/);

• SDK: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/);

• Interface: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui);

• Fonts: The label is Helvetica. The weight and unit
are [League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic).

• The "metrics" widget is comprised of the following pieces:

- Label, STRING (ex: "Upper Body" or "Core")
- Weight, INTEGER (between 0 and 350)
- Unit (always "lbs")
- Background circle with graph

• Project included a screen that demonstrates "metrics" widget use. This screen also included a form
that allows the user to modify the Label and the Weight to see the widget update as changes are made
to the form.

• Code organization: The widget is separated from the demo webpage. It is easy to navigate the
project.

• Code quality: The code is understandable and commented when necessary. The widget is written with
the understanding that it will be used in many different places and require additional features in
the future.
